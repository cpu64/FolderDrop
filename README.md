# Inner workings
The idea behind FolderDrop application is to enable file sharing through Universal Plug and Play â€“ Internet Gateway Device protocol, which enables the app to automatically open ports on the router, making a local service available for access from the internet. This is achieved by using `igd` library in python. Below you can see a scheme of the how the protocol works.
